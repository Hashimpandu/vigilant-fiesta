# vigilant-fiesta
Ongoing within our tourist island here in Zanzibar. for many years being associated with various tourist incidents, committing acts such as lifting starfish in the water, operating fire engines at sea, stopping. over coral and degradation of fish sources and plastic dumps along the sea as well as degradation of clothing values and other social values. we need to eradicate this through our community and our fellow human beings. there are many we should learn from our fellow righteous tourists who care about our environment meaning that caring for people is yours and turns spiritually into our collective. together let us maintain an environment and peace over world stability.
